# Essential-web-loader-with-js

This is a simple web page that displays a blurry loading effect while an image is being loaded. The page gradually blurs the background image and updates the loading progress percentage until it reaches 100%. Once the image is fully loaded, the loading text disappears.


EXPLANATION

The HTML structure consists of a section element with the class bg for the background image, and a div element with the class loading-text to display the loading progress.
The CSS file (style.css) contains the styling for the page, including the background image, font, and positioning.
The JavaScript file (script.js) handles the loading animation. It gradually increases the load variable from 0 to 100, updating the loading text and applying a blur effect to the background image accordingly. Once the loading reaches 100%, the loading text is hidden.
